          An eating disorder is a serious mental illness characterised by disruptions in food and eating-related thoughts, behaviours, and attitudes.

          <h1> How to talk to someone about their eating disorder </h1>
        </section>
        <p>
          It's often difficult for someone with an eating disorder to accept it and make a change. Eating disorders can distort the way a victim thinks about their body, the world, and sometimes even someone’s motivation to help them. Often times victims of an eating disorder fall into a state of denial or turn defensive when confronted about their eating patterns, so it’s best advised to tread carefully when bringing up the subject.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Be prepared for denial</h4>
          Before you attempt to express your concerns about an eating disorder to a loved one, make sure you're prepared for the possibility that the person will become defensive or angry. The conversation can feel very confronting and threatening to an individual with an eating disorder make sure you're mentally prepared for the possibility before attempting to talk to the victim.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Pick a safe place</h4>
          Picking a safe place and good time is essential because it can influence the path the conversation goes. Make sure to pick somewhere private and where you both feel safe. Make sure you're alone or with another person who the individual would feel comfortable with. Don't confront the individual in a public setting which could trigger defensiveness because of the nature of the area. A public area could also make the individual feel embarrased and fall into the state of denial you're trying to avoid. Another reason to steer clear public areas is so you're free of unnessesary interruptions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Explain why you're concerned</h4>
          Try to avoid lecturing or critisism as this can trigger defensiveness related to the topic. Keep the conversation casual and calm, and express your concerns without lashing out. Make sure to state a few examples of your concerns so the victim can see the problem from another eye. Keep the conversation peaceful and do not offer solutions and treatments yet. You're only goal at this moment is to make them feel safe and comfortable, and understanding of your desire to help.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Offering help</h4>
          Offering help to a loved one with an eating disorder could feel very confronting and distressing, so be cautious not to suggest it immediately. Work the suggestion into the conversation but do not go into any further detail unless the person in question states that they wish to look for help. Being offered help can make the individual feel distressed so avoid stating more then one or two treatment options, and when you do, do not say anything more then the name of the treatmeant as too much detail could make the loved one feel overwhelmed.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
          <h4>Don't:</h2>
          • Critisise the individual's appearence. Most eating disorders are driven by appearence so critisising the looks of the victim will only worsen the problem.
          <br>
          • State that recovery is possible. This can provide the victim with a feeling of hope which could help them get treatement.
          <br>
          • Be patient with the individual's behaviours. Eating disorders aren't an issue that can be resolved overnight or with one pep-talk.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Do:</h4>
          • Remain calm. Show care and compassion and listen without judgement. Most people with an eating disorder feel a lot of emotional pain when acknowledging the problem.
          <br>
          • State that recovery is possible. This can provide the victim with a feeling of hope which could help them get treatement.
