            <h1> Different types of depression </h1>
          </section>
          When someone mentions depression, usually the first thing someone thinks of is the symptoms found most commonly in Clinical Depression. A common misconseption is that there is only one type of depression when in fact there are many, and here is a small list of the most common types of depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <section id="clinical-depression">
            <h2> Clinical Depression </h2>
          </section>
          Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), also known as Clinical Depression is a severe form of depression that involves low mood and/or loss of interest in usual daily activities that were once enjoyable. To be properly diagnosed, you must experience symptoms most days for over two weeks.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Causes </h3>
          Usually, there is no single cause for Depressive Disorders, however there are common causes among individuals diagnosed. A short list of causes includes:
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Stressful events</h4>
          If you experience a stressful event such as a relationship breakdown, there is a higher risk of becoming depressed, especially if you close yourself off from family and friends and attempt to deal with the problem in question by yourself.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Personality</h4>
          Specific personality traits could make you more vulnarable to Depressive Disorders. Low self-esteem and extremely self-critical behaviour could lead to a depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Family History</h4>
          If there is a family history of diagnosed depression or depressive symptoms, it makes you more likely to experience depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Alcohol and/or Drugs</h4>
          Alcohol and drugs affect the chemistry of the human brain, which increases the risk of depression. Trying to cope with negative emotions through drugs and/or alcohol has the possibility of a spiral of depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Illness</h4>
          There is a high risk of depression if you experience a longstanding and/or lifethreatening illness such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. A head injury, both major and minor, could trigger mood swings, unstable emotions, and emotion problems in general.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Symptoms </h3>
          • Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
          <br>
          • Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
          <br>
          • Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports
          <br>
          • Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much
          <br>
          • Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
          <br>
          • Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
          <br>
          • Anxiety, agitation or restlessness
          <br>
          • Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
          <br>
          • Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
          <br>
          • Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
          <br>
          • Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide
          <br>
          • Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches
          <br>
          <br>
          <section id="bipolar-disorder">
            <h2> Bipolar Disorder </h2>
          </section>
          Bipolar Disorder, also known as Manic Depression is a disorder characterised by extreme shifts in mood, resulting in episodes of mood swings that range from manic highs to depressive lows.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Causes </h3>

          <br>
          <h4>• Chemical inbalance</h4>
          The neurotransmitters in the brain that control noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine can become inbalanced, which is believed to be a cause of bipolar disorder.

          <br>
          <h4>•  Cyclothymia</h4>

          <section id="postpartum-depression">
            <h2> Postpartum depression </h2>
          </section>
          Postpartum Depression (PPD), also known as Perinatal Depression is a form of depression that occurs within a year following the birth of a baby. Although many women experience what is called "baby blues", it shouldn't last longer then two weeks. To be properly diagnosed with PPD, you must experience symptoms most days for over two weeks.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Causes </h3>
          Although the cause for Postpartum Depression isn't clear, there are some factors that may either contribute or make you more vulnerable incuding:
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Hormones</h4>
          Giving birth leads to a massive drop in the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which leads to mood swings, tiredness, anxiety, sadness, etc, which is the cause of baby blues. The drop of these hormones can also be the cause of postpartum depression if it lasts two weeks or longer.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Self-image</h4>
          Struggling with self-image is often a contributing factor to other depressive disorders, and with the combined stress of birth, a child, life can feel out of control and some struggle with their sense of identity.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Family History</h4>
          A history of depressive disorders in a family can contribute to experiencing depressive disorders, including postpartum depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Stressful events</h4>
          Birth and the first few weeks of parenthood is a stressful stage of life, and any added stress such as a recent break up or bereavement can be a cause of postpartum depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Symptoms </h3>
          • Feeling sad or crying a lot
          <br>
          • Feeling overwhelmed
          <br>
          • Having thoughts of hurting the baby or yourself
          <br>
          • Not having an interest in the baby
          <br>
          • Having no energy or motivation
          <br>
          • Feeling worthless, guilty, or like you are a bad parent
          <br>
          • Sleeping too much or too little
          <br>
          • Change in relationship with food
          <br>
          • Feeling anxious
          <br>
          • Having chronic headaches, aches, pains, or stomach problems

          <section id="psychotic-depression">
            <h2> Psychotic Depression </h2>
          </section>
          Psychotic Depression is the label given to a group of depressive disorders that affect the mind and thoughts, leading to hallucinations, delusions, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Causes </h3>
          Experts are yet to discover a single specific cause for Psychotic Depression, however they have discovered several possible causes, including:
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Environmental Factors</h4>
          Experiencing trauma or stressful events in the past, especially in early childhood hightens the risk of all depressive disorders, including Psychotic Depression.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Brain Chemistry</h4>
          Dopamine and Seratonin imbalances often play a role in most mental health conditions, including depression, psychosis, etc. Some evidence also suggest that stress hormones also may play a part.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>• Genetics</h4>
          It's been discovered that some individuals are more likely to develop a form of depression if a first-degree relative (parents, sibling, or child) also has a depressive disorder.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Symptoms </h3>

          <br>
          •  you have unique or special powers
          <br>
          • Believing you’re a famous person or historical figure
          <br>
          •  voices criticizing or mocking you
          <br>
          • Seeing a frightening or threatening animal following you
          <br>
