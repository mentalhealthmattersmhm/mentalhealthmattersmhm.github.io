        </section>
        <p>
          Suicide is death caused by injury to one's self with the intention of death.

            <h2> 9 Common myths about Suicide </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>Talking about suicide can encourge someone</h3>
          There is a widespread stigma associated with suicide and as a result, many people are afraid to speak about it. Talking about suicide not only reduces the stigma, but also allows individuals to seek help, rethink their opinions and share their story with others.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>A person who was once suidical will always be suicidal</h3>
          Heightened suicide risk is often short-term and situation-specific. While suicidal thoughts may return, they’re not permanent. Someone who has experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts can go on to live a long life.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Suicide only affects those with mental illnesses</h3>
          Suicidal behaviour indicates deep unhappiness, not necessarily a mental health issue. Many people living with mental health issues aren’t suicidal, and not all people who take their own lives have a mental health issue.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Suicides usually happen without warning</h3>
          Most suicides are preceded by verbal or behavioural warning signs. Some suicides occur without any obvious warning.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>If a person attempts and fails, they will not attempt again</h3>
          A suicide attempt is regarded as an indicator of further attempts. It is likely that the level of danger will increase with each further suicide attempt.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Suicidal threats and attempts are just attention seeking</h3>
          Many people assume that threating or even attempting suicide is a form of attention seeking. All suicidal attempts and threats must be treated as though the person has the intent to die.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>All young people are suicidal</h3>
          Although media does spread the idea of suicide, it does not solely cause suicides. In reality, majority of suicides come from the older generations.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Suicide is painless</h3>
          The fact is, many suicide methods are extremely painful. Fictional portrayals of suicide do not usually include the reality of the pain.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Suicidal people are selfish</h3>
          People do not die by suicide because they do not want to live.  People die by suicide because they want to end their suffering. These individuals are suffering so deeply that they feel helpless and hopeless.
          <br>

          <section id="Signs">
            <h2> Signs of suicidal thoughts </h2>
