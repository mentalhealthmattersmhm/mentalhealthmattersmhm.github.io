          <h1> What is Self-Harm? </h1>
        </section>
        <p>
          Self-harm refers to when an individual deliberately injures themselves. This could include common methods such as cutting, scratching, hair pulling, burning, or biting.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although most self-harming behaviour is done without the intention of dying, the risk of accidental death is still there. Sometimes, when a self-harming individual is not satisfied, there is a high chance of further injury. This can lead to an accidental death or can lead to suicidal thoughts.

          <section id="why">
            <h2> Why do people self-harm? </h2>
          </section>
          The two main reasons behind self-harming behaviour is either emotional distress or emotional numbness.
          <br>
          <br>
          Emotional distress can be caused by many things, but usually is either triggered by an event, or is caused by the build up of emotion. These emotions can range from anger, to sadness, to other, more painful emotions such as fear, loneliness, guilt, or shame. In this case, it may ba as a distraction or as a coping mechanism.
          <br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, someone could be feeling emotionally numb and want to 'feel something'. Sometimes, a painful experience can leave an individual emotionally numb and with a feeling of emptiness. In this case, self-harm is often a method to try feel something, even if it is physical pain.
          <br>
          <br>
          Other reasons for self-harming behaviours can include: exposure to the behaviour, self-punishment, or a need for control.

            <h2> How to help someone self-harming </h2>
          </section>
          If a loved one is showing the warning signs of self-harming behaviour, express your concern in a loving position rather then yelling, threatening, or shaming, which can lead to further self-injuries. Encouraging to see an expert is the best thing to do so they can get professional support and advice.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Tips for supporting someone</h3>
          •	 Don’t ignore or dismiss your concerns
          <br>
          •	 Don’t make ultimatums or try to force the person to stop: this is likely to make things worse
          <br>
          •	 Don’t agree to keep secrets: it is possible that the person’s safety is at risk from their self-harm. This means you may have to tell somebody else to keep them safe. If this happens only tell the people who need to know (e.g. a counsellor/teacher/parent)
          <br>
          •	 Don’t panic and jump to conclusions about why the person is self-harming. Don’t assume you know the reason - instead ask about the feelings that are driving their self-harm.
          <br>
          •	 Don't threaten to take away their control
          <br>
          •	 Don't insult and put down their feelings and emotions
          <br>
          <br>
          •	 Do encourage the person to get support from a health professional: getting help earlier means any underlying problems that do exist can be detected and the person can get appropriate support
          <br>
          •	 Do look after yourself: consider whether you need to get some advice and support for yourself (e.g. from a helpline/ counsellor or a friend)
          <br>
          •	 Do educate yourself about self-harm
          <br>
          •	 Do try to manage your own emotions. This will help you to approach the person in a calm and non-threatening manner
          <br>
          •	 Do ask the person directly if they are feeling suicidal
          <br>
          •	 Do recognise that their self-harm may be one of their only coping tools and that asking them to give it up can be very frightening
          <br>
          •	 Do try and be as open with the person as possible: If you need to tell somebody else about their self-harm to keep them safe, try to speak to them about this first

            <h2> 7 Common myths about Self-Harm </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>Only girls self-harm</h3>
          Although there are more females over males who self-harm, it is untrue that only girls do. About 30-40% of people who self-injure are male.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Self-harming is attention seeking</h3>
          In some cases, self-injury is clearly a means of gaining attention. Honoring the intent is extremely important in this case - Someone who injures themselves for attention clearly needs it for one reason or another. The majority of people who engage in self-harm, however, go to great extents to cover their injuries.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Only teenagers self-harm</h3>
          While it is statistically true that most people who engage in self-harm are teenagers, people of all ages practice self-injury.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Self-harm is a thing only emo/goth people do</h3>
          It is a common misconseption that only people of certain subgroups practice self-harm. Self-injury excludes no one and affects people of all races, backgrounds, genders, sexualities, education levels, subgroups, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Cutting is the only form of self-harm</h3>
          Cutting is the most common method of self-harm but isn't the only method. Studies also show that majority of those who self-harm engage in multiple methods of self-harm, including burning, hair pulling, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>People self-harm as a way to fit in</h3>
          Self-harm majority of the time is not an extreme way to fit in and is rather a coping stratagy to try manage difficult emotions, so in most cases, no, fitting in is not the end goal.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Self-harm is just a suicide attempt</h3>
          Although media does spread the idea of suicide, it does not solely cause suicides. In reality, majority of suicides come from the older generations.
