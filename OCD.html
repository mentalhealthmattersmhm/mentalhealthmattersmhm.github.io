        </section>
        <p>
          OCD, short of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a mental disorder that involves patterns of unwanted thoughts, fears, obsessions, and repetitive behaviours that interfer with daily life.

            <h2> 5 Common myths about OCD </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>OCD is just cleanliness</h3>
          Although cleanliness is a common compulsion of OCD, it is not the only one. Common compulsions of OCD can include things such as:
          <br>
          • Hoarding
          <br>
          • Checking things
          <br>
          • Repetative behaviours (writing, reading, tapping)
          <br>
          • Counting
          <br>
          • Praying
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Only women have OCD</h3>
          Experts have found that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder affects people regardless of sex, background, ethnicity, and race. The reason it is commonly thought that only women have OCD is because men are more likely to be diagnosed in children however in adolescence and adulthood, women are more likely to be diagnosed. About 1.5 to 1 which makes it almost equal.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>OCD isn't treatable</h3>
          OCD has been found to not have a cure, though it is treatable. Symptoms, such as compulsions can be managed with specific treatments that can vary from therapies such as exposure therapy to medication.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>We’re all ‘a little OCD’</h3>
          A common misconseption is that OCD is just a personality trait, however this idea surrounding OCD is completely wrong. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a serious mental disorder that involves high levels of Anxiety and emotional distress.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>People with OCD just need to relax</h3>
          Most people believe that if you have OCD, relaxing should fix the problem, however for many diagnosed with this condition, it's not possible. Some think that OCD is just an overreaction to life stresses and they just need to relax, however in reality, OCD is uncontrollable fears and compulsions that can interfer with a persons daily life.

          Although similar, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder are two different mental disorders with different clinical definitions.

          <br>
          <h4>Symptoms</h4>
          Some symptoms of the two do overlap, such as the similar thoughts and behaviours, however there are some differences.
          <br>
          <br>
          OCD is a mental disorder characterised by by intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. Symptoms of OCD can fluctuate with Anxiety and individuals with OCD are usually aware.
