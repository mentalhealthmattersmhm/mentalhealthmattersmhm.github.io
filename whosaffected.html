        </section>
        <p>
          A common myth surrounding eating disorders is that it only affects white, middle class females, generally adolescent girls.
          <br>
          <br>
          The statement above is completely untrue. Eating disorders can affect anyone of any cultural background, class, gender identity, sexuality, age, shape, size, profession, and economic status. Eating disorders affect any person of any background and doesn't discriminate.

            <h4> What may cause eating disorders or body image issues for LGBTIQA+ people? </h4>
            <br>
            Homophobia, transphobia, discrimination, bullying, trauma, abuse and alienation from friends or family members can all result in high levels of emotional stress. Another reason for eating disorders among the LGBT community, especially trans people is the desire to fit into the beauty standards of the individual's gender.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4> Facts </h4>
            - Compared to heterosexual individuals, people who are LGBTIQA+ are at greater risk for disordered eating behaviours
            <br>
            - Gay, lesbian, and bisexual teens may be at higher risk of binge-eating than their heterosexual peers
            <br>
            - 2/3 of trans young people report limiting their eating because of their gender identity
            <br>
            - Among males who have eating disorders, 42% identify as gay
            <br>
            - Gay males were seven times more likely to report binging and 12 times more likely to report purging than heterosexual males.
