          <h1> What is Post traumatic stress disorder? </h1>
        </section>
        <p>
          Post traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD is a psychiatric condition that may occur if an individual either witnessed or experienced a traumatic event in the past.
          <br>

            <h2> 4 Common myths about PTSD </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>PTSD only affects war veterans and soldiers</h3>
          Although PTSD is often associated with war veterns, it affects people with other experiences as well such as childhood trauma, domestic violence, etc. Soldiers are at a higher risk of PTSD, but it doesn't affect only them.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>PTSD is a sign of weakness</h3>
          PTSD is not a sign of weakness and is in fact linked to changes in the individual's brain as well as having an altered fear response. PTSD can affect different parts of the brain such as memory, attention, and other cognative functions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>People with PTSD are violent</h3>
          Having PTSD can be distressing at times and different people react differently to situations. Some withdraw, some are jumpy, and a small portion of people with PTSD may act violently. A common misconseption is that all people with PTSD are violent, although some are, most aren't.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Everyone with PTSD have the same symptoms</h3>
          The fact is that PTSD can present itself completely differently from person to person. There are very few symptoms which are present for all indivduals with PTSD. Some may experience mostly physical symptoms while another may only experience negative thoughts.
          <br>
          <br>
          <section id="causes">
            <h2> Causes </h2>
          </section>
          PTSD is caused by the failure to fully recover after a stressful, traumatic, or distressing event. The most common cause of PTSD is an MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident).
          <br>
          <br>
          <section id="symptoms">
            <h2> Symptoms </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          Post traumatic symptoms usually begin a month after the traumatic event. Symptoms of PTSD are usually split into four categories: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative thoughts and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> Intrusive Memories </h4>
          • Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
          <br>
          • Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
          <br>
          • Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
          <br>
          • Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> Avoidance </h4>
          • Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event
          <br>
          • Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> Negative thoughts and mood </h4>
          • Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world
          <br>
          • Hopelessness about the future
          <br>
          • Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event
          <br>
          • Difficulty maintaining close relationships
          <br>
          • Feeling detached from family and friends
          <br>
          • Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed
          <br>
          • Difficulty experiencing positive emotions
          <br>
          • Feeling emotionally numb
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> Changed reactions </h4>
          • Being easily startled or frightened
          <br>
          • Always being on guard for danger
          <br>
          • Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast
          <br>
          • Trouble sleeping
          <br>
          • Trouble concentrating
          <br>
          • Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior
          <br>
          • Overwhelming guilt or shame
          <br>
          <br>
          <section id="Types">
            <h2> Types of PTSD </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Normal Stress Response</h4>
          Normal stress response occurs prior to PTSD. However, it does not always progress to full-blown disorder. Accidents, injuries, illnesses, surgeries, and other sources of excessive tension and stress can all trigger this response. Normal stress responses can typically be effectively managed with the help of loved ones, peers, and individual or group therapy sessions. Individuals suffering from a normal stress response should recover in a matter of weeks.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Acute Stress Disorder</h4>
          While not the same as PTSD, acute stress disorder can occur in people who have been exposed to what is or feels like a life-threatening event. Natural disasters, the loss of loved ones, the loss of a job, or the threat of death are all sources of stress that can cause acute stress disorder. If left untreated, acute stress disorder can progress to PTSD. Individual and group therapy, medication, and treatment options designed by a psychiatrist can all be used to treat acute stress disorder.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Uncomplicated PTSD</h4>
          Uncomplicated PTSD is linked to a single major traumatic event rather than multiple events, and is the simplest form of PTSD to treat. Avoidance of trauma reminders, nightmares, flashbacks to the event, irritability, mood changes, and changes in relationships are all symptoms of uncomplicated PTSD. Uncomplicated  PTSD can be treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Complex PTSD</h4>
          Uncomplicated PTSD is the polar opposite of complex PTSD. It is caused by a combination of traumatic events, not just one. Abuse or domestic violence cases, repeated exposure to war or community violence, or sudden loss are all common causes of complex PTSD. While they share symptoms, complex PTSD treatment is a little more intense than uncomplicated PTSD treatment. Individuals with complex PTSD may also have borderline or antisocial personality disorder, as well as dissociative disorders. They have behavioural problems such as impulsivity, aggression, substance abuse, or sexual impulsivity. They may also display extreme emotional issues such as rage, depression, or panic.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>•  Comorbid PTSD</h4>
          Comorbid PTSD is a blanket term for all co-occurring disorders. It's used when a person has multiple mental health issues, often in conjunction with substance abuse issues. Comorbid PTSD is extremely common, as many people have more than one condition. The best results are obtained when both the comorbid mental health condition and the comorbid PTSD are treated concurrently. Many people who have PTSD attempt to treat it on their own. Self-medication and other destructive behaviours are examples of this.
