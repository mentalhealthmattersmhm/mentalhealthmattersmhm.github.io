          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression is just sadness</h3>
          Many people mistakenly believe that depression is just a fancy word for sadness. Sadness is characterised by a short-term feeling of unhappiness however depression is in the simplest terms, long-term feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression isn't real</h3>
          A common misconseption regarding depression is that it doesn't actually exist and is an excuse. Although some people do fake having depression, it is a very real and can at times be an extremely dangerous mental illness resulting in over 700 000 deaths each year.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression only affects women</h3>
          Often times, it's believed that only women have depression, which has been proven multiple times that the statement above is completely false. Because of social pressures, men are more likely not to address feelings and signs of depression because society sees it as a sign of weakness. Because of this, most men do not get the proper diagnosis they need.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression is only in the head</h3>
          Even though majority of society views Depression as being merely a neurological condition, it has many physical signs and symptoms. Although Depression is mostly thoughts, emotions, etc, it does affect the physical wellbeing of an individual, including a disorganised sleeping pattern, fatigue, aches and pains, distruptions is eating habits, weight gain/loss, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression is a sign of weakness</h3>
          The only reason Depression is seen as a sign of weakness is because society has labled Depression as simply sadness and society views as prolonged sadness as a sign of weakness. Depression is a contidition that can be caused by multiple factors including family history, medical conditions, etc, but simply being sad for a long time is not considered a common cause.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression is just self-pity</h3>
          Unlike self-pity or sadness, Depression is more then an emotion, affecting the body as a whole (thoughts, feelings, etc). Self-pity is not a diagnosable condition and is rather an emotion, unlike Depression which is a diagnosable condition that involves not only the feelings of a person (emotions), but also their thoughts and actions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression is a normal part of growing up</h3>
          Adolescence can be a difficult time, emotionally, socially, and psychologically, but depression is not nessesarily a normal part of this experience. Although a lot of teenagers have diagnosed depression, it is not a biological event that occurs for everyone to properly transition into adulthood, nor is it a normal experience that everyone should expect to experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Depression can be cured by keeping busy</h3>
          Although having a healthy lifestyle could reduce some symptoms of depression, it does not cure it. A commonly heard misconseption is that just "keeping busy" can help cure depression, and this statement, although some facts are incorperated, as a whole, is untrue. Keeping busy can help as a distraction, and a healthy lifestyle of sleep and exercise can help ease symptoms, it does not cure depression.
