            <h3> About Mental Health Matters </h3>
          </section>
          Mental Health Matters is an informative website created to educate the public about Mental Health and provide easily accessible information about Mental Health and Illnesses.

            <h3> My Mission </h3>
            My mission is to spread awareness and educate others so that people struggling can get help without feeling embarrassed or worried about being ridiculed. It is my goal to prevent false assumptions and mockery of mental illnesses.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also want to create a safe website for individuals looking for research material without stumbling across harmful information that can damage the Mental Health of someone.
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3> Where it began </h3>
          I’ve struggled with different aspects of mental health for several years, and after I began opening up about it, I realised how many people were uneducated about the severity of such problems. For what seemed like the longest time, I was being mocked and told to ignore the problems to make them go away.
          <br>
          <br>
          I decided I would try to educate people so others struggling wouldn’t have to be bullied and mocked for getting support and wouldn’t be ridiculed for seeking help.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> My Story </h3>
          At a young age, I witnessed what can be described as a traumatic event and since then I’ve struggled with my own mental health. This included self-worth issues, guilt, struggles with mood and eating difficulties.
          <br>
          <br>
          The traumatic event caused me constant feelings of guilt and lack of self-worth, which affected my mood quite often. After a while, I began feeling worthless. Experiencing constant negative comments about my body, from friends, family members, and classmates led to struggles with my eating habits which eventually led to an eating disorder.
          <br>
          <br>
          As I grew to realise my mental health was going downhill, I got interested in the topic and began to do research, but my lack of knowledge on which websites were good and reliable, I ended up on the side of the internet I hope nobody ends up on. The triggering content I discovered led to the worsening of my mental health. It led to me knowing information I wish I never saw and providing me with the idea of certain habits I wish I never had.
          <br>
          <br>
          My behaviours regarding my psychological wellbeing got mocked and I grew nervous and afraid to seek help. With the support of close friends, I gathered enough courage to find help for myself and eventually, my mental health started improving.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although I still struggle sometimes, it’s better knowing I’ve got a support system of many loyal, trustworthy friends. Some of my behaviours haven’t quite gone away and neither has the guilt, but with many different supportive people and professional assistance, I slowly got better.
          <br>
          <br>
          To this day, I believe if I had access to a website I knew was safe and wouldn't be triggering, I wouldn't have had to go through nearly as much.
