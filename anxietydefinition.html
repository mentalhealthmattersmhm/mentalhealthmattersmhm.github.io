            <h2> 4 Common myths about Anxiety </h2>
          </section>
          <br>
          <h3>Anxiety isn't a real illness</h3>
          Anxiety is a legitimate and diagnosable psychiatric disorder. Anxiousness, stress, and worry are all common emotions. Worrying about work, finances, or personal issues can help people anticipate and resolve issues. Because feeling worried or anxious is common and, in small doses, may be helpful in anticipating problems, many people may question whether anxiety is a real mental illness.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Social Anxiety is just being shy</h3>
          Although some symptoms may be similar, social anxiety is an anxiety disorder, whereas shyness is considered a personality trait. Social anxiety disorder is characterised by a contiuous fear of social situations. Someone with social anxiety is preoccupied with the fear of embarrassing themselves or being surveyed by others in a social situation while on the other hand shyness in the simplest terms is slight discomfort in public situation.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>You can see when someone has Anxiety</h3>
          Although anxiety is extremely debilitating for those who suffer from it, it is frequently unrecognisable by those around them. It can be difficult to tell if someone has an anxiety disorder. This may be because of reasons such as:
          <br>
          <br>
          • Feeling embarrassed or ashamed of anxiety symptoms
          <br>
          • Using other excuses to avoid anxiety-inducing situations
          <br>
          • Experiencing situation-specific anxiety or panic attacks in private
          <br>
          • Coping strategies that keep their symptoms from being noticeable
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Medication is the only way to manage Anxiety</h3>
          Anxiety disorders come in a variety of forms, with varying symptoms and severity. Similarly, there are numerous treatment options available for people with anxiety. Although medication is one option for anxiety management and can be life-changing for some people, there are other effective alternatives available as well.

          <section id="causes">
            <h2> Causes </h2>
          </section>
          The exact cause of Anxiety hasn't been found, however there are some established risk factors.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Trauma
          <br>
          People who have experienced trauma in the past are more likely to develop Anxiety at some point in their life.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Illness
          <br>
          Having an illness, whether it's terminal, physical, etc, can lead to mass amounts of worry which can trigger Anxiety.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Stress buildup
          <br>
          A stressful event or life situations such as work or a death that causes mass amounts of stress can lead to excessive Anxiety.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Personality
          <br>
          Some specific personality types and traits can make an individual more vulnurable to Anxiety then others.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Other mental health disorders
          <br>
          Having other mental illness and disorders such as a Depressive Disorder can highten someone's risk of developing Anxiety.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Drugs and/or alcohol
          <br>
          Although drugs and/or alcohol is unlikely to cause Anxiety in itself but the misuse or withdrawal can worsen existing symptoms.
          <br>
          <br>
          • Family history
          <br>
          Anxiety can be passed down through blood-related family which can be the cause for some people.
